Coding Tracker

Features:
- SQLite DB with the connection strip stored in an appsettings.json file
- Console built with Spectre for tidy user interaction

Challenges:
- This was my first time using configuration builder to interact with a json file. I got some help from the C#Sharp Academy discord in the form of a YouTube video to watch that explained it well.
- This project was larger than previous projects so organization was difficult at first. I changed the overall organization of the code more times than I could count, but the end product is organized and understandable


Areas to Improve:
- I really need to improve my overall naming abilities. I kept getting confused by the names on my methods, properties, and variables. The KISS standard of keeping things simple should help with that going forward.
- I also need to improve my understanding of access identifiers, static, and the abstract keyword.
- Finally, I need to do a better job of passing parameters into methods as opposed to setting them equal to a variable inside a method to make it accessible within.
